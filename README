Wemaux = Faux Wemo, or Fake Wemo.  


Wemaux provides a simple UPNP and HTTP daemon to spoof an authentic Belkin Wemo outlet or switch.  This can be useful to add support for a non-Wemo switch 
on your network and still use Belkin-compatible software for turning lights on and off.


[Current Progress]

This code is about 90% complete.  What's currently not working are UPNP replies to M-SEARCH requests.  The Belkin Wemo mobile app does seem to detect
the fake device since it does request the setup.xml and firmware.xml after queries services.  However, no device shows up in the app.  And, additionally
the fake device never shows up on general UPNP searches using other debug apps (also see test/discover.pl).
